📘 Task 3 – Sales Prediction

The objective of this project is to predict product sales based on advertising
expenditure on different media platforms such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper
using a machine learning regression model.

📊 Dataset

Dataset Used: Advertising Dataset

Features:

TV advertising budget

Radio advertising budget

Newspaper advertising budget

Target Variable:

Sales

The dataset contains historical advertising expenditure data along with
corresponding sales values and is commonly used to demonstrate regression
techniques in machine learning.

🛠️ Approach

The following steps were followed in this project:

Loaded the advertising dataset using pandas

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution

Analyzed correlations between advertising channels and sales

Selected relevant features and target variable

Split the dataset into training and testing sets

Trained a Linear Regression model

Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score

Visualized actual vs predicted sales values

🤖 Machine Learning Model

Algorithm Used: Linear Regression
Problem Type: Regression

Linear Regression was chosen due to its simplicity and effectiveness in
modeling the relationship between advertising expenditure and sales values.

📈 Results

The model achieved a good R² score, indicating strong predictive performance

TV advertising showed the highest influence on sales

Predicted sales values were closely aligned with actual values, as shown
in the visualization

🧠 Conclusion

The project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict
continuous values such as sales. By analyzing advertising data, the model
was able to learn meaningful relationships between marketing spend and sales,
highlighting the importance of data-driven decision-making in business.
