📘 Task 1 – Iris Flower Classification

The objective of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species —
Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their sepal and petal
measurements using a machine learning classification model.

🌸 Dataset
Dataset Used: Iris Dataset (from scikit-learn)
Features:
Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width

Target Variable:
Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

The Iris dataset is a well-known benchmark dataset commonly used for learning and demonstrating classification algorithms.

🛠️ Approach
The following steps were followed in this project:
1.Loaded the Iris dataset using scikit-learn
2.Converted the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
3.Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4.Visualized feature relationships using pair plots
5.Split the dataset into training and testing sets
6.Trained a Logistic Regression classification model
7.Evaluated model performance using accuracy and classification report

🤖 Machine Learning Model
Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
Problem Type: Multi-class Classification
Logistic Regression was chosen due to its simplicity and effectiveness for linearly separable classification problems like the Iris dataset.

📊 Results
The model achieved high accuracy on the test dataset.
Clear separation between species was observed, especially using petal length and petal width features.

🧠 Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can be used to classify data into multiple categories. The Iris dataset’s clean structure and well-separated classes make it ideal for understanding classification concepts and model evaluation.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
